- Currently focused on: [Stereoscopic vision for a Mars rover](https://github.com/knei-knurow/stereo-cxx), [Artificial Neural Networks](https://github.com/doodek/ai-course)
- Programming AVR Microcontrollers in C since 2016. Created a decent amount of [AVR C CODE](https://github.com/doodek/avr-c-demos), which I migrate to GitHub when I am too tired to do anything more productive.
- Loves STM32 microcontrollers.

- ⚡ i use arch btw → [dotfiles](https://github.com/doodek/dotfiles). Tried to use Vim daily, failed.
